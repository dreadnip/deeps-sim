#Deeps-sim
My attempts at simulating the perfect d00ps rotations

##To do

* Add other styles (magic/melee)
* Work on the algorithm, because it's obviously not 100% correct
* Make it input a custom ability damage value to calculate DPS with
* Add options for things like limited timeframes, movement, ultimates, etc..
